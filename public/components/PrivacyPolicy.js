          <ul>
            <li><b>Email Address and Contact Data</b> - In requesting access to and accessing the Service, you will log in via third party authentication tools (such as LinkedIn), which will give us access to your name, email address and other information contained in your profiles associated with such third party services that is made available to us (“SNS Content”).  Your relationship with the third party service providers associated with your SNS Content is governed by your agreements with such parties and the privacy policies which they follow.
              <ul>
                <li><b>How we use Email Address and Contact Data.</b> If you have not yet registered for the Service, we may use your email address to contact you with marketing messages about the Service.

This data will not be shares in any way that would allow third parties to identify an individual user of the Service.</li>
                    <li><b>Personalization</b> - at the User level, to provide a personalized experience of the Services for each User.</li>
